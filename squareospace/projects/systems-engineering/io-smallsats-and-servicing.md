During my time at Infinite Orbits, alongside my work on the development of autonomous vision-based satellite navigation solutions, I also supported systems engineers in designing the related space missions and spacecraft hosting the optical payloads I was working on.
<br><br>

The first mission consisted of a 16U **geostationary cubesat** (left image) hosting both RF and optical payloads.
The satellite has a twofold purpose:
- to provide a testbed for vision-based navigation algorithms, particularly for far-range space object detection & tracking and for proximity operations
- to offer bring-into-use (BIU) services to geostationary operators, combining technology demonstrations with early revenue generation.
<br>

During my last year at the company, I also contributed to the design of _Endurance_ (right image), a larger **robotic spacecraft** capable of:
- providing life extension services to geostationary satellites running out of propellant or affected by control system failures, by taking over orbital station-keeping and/or pointing control
- performing orbital relocation of space objects, e.g. to guarantee safe disposal.
