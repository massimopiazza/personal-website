After 3 years in France working at Infinite Orbits, I moved to Berlin where I joined Rivada Space Networks as a _System Budgets Engineer_.

During my time at the company, I contributed to designing the _OuterNET_: an orbital network for **Carrier Ethernet** connectivity. The constellation architecture is designed to provide **gateway-less** point-to-point connectivity between users anywhere on the globe, with a unique combination of low latency, high throughput and high security.  
This is enabled by a constellation of 576 satellites, each connected via laser links to four other spacecraft, thus creating a fully meshed private network with no touch points on the ground other than user terminals. This physical separation at the infrastructure level significantly enhances cybersecurity and data sovereignty, on a global scale.  
The constellation will consist of 500 kg class satellites, each equipped with active multi-beam phased arrays for Ka-band communications, and distributed across 24 polar orbital planes at an altitude of 1050 km. Each spacecraft will guarantee 10 Gbps of individual throughput, with a worst-case Round-Trip Time < 260 ms between two user terminals anywhere on Earth.

My contributions to the program included:
- Systems Engineer responsible for system-wide **technical budgets** of a 600-satellite LEO constellation, coordinating closely with performance engineers and contractors
- **Requirements/interface management** and cross-segment design integration, across Space/Ground/User segments + V&V support
- **Precursor mission** support, including ConOps and planning of incremental capability demonstrations
- **MBSE** modeling support (Capella-based), including development of automated workflows and SW interfaces aimed at improving traceability and removing the human-in-the-loop
- Toolchain **integration** between E2E simulation, reqs. management, V&V, and MBSE environments
