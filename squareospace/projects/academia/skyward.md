During my time at the Polytechnic University of Milan, I spent two years very actively involved with Skyward Experimental Rocketry.

In 2016, I joined the **Aerodynamics & Flight Dynamics** (AFD) department, initially focusing on flight dynamics and CFD simulations for the _Cyrano_ program.

The program was centered around developing a jet-powered composite UAV, entirely built by students. The aircraft was designed to be capable of deploying an air-launched sounding rocket, the _Rocksanne I-X_ (also built by Skyward), through an aerobatic maneuver known as the "half Cuban eight".

One year later, I become the **Head of AFD**, hence leading the teams across both the UAV and sounding rocket programs.
