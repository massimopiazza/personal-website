After a few years as an indie software developer, during which I launched multiple apps on the iOS App Store, I founded the mobile software company [WatchApp, Inc.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170923014153/http://www.watchapp.com:80/) at the age of 17.

I therefore joined [Farbod Saraf](https://farbodsaraf.com) and [Sara Tashakorinia](https://www.saratashakorinia.work) as co-founder & CTO of the company. Together we launched **Canvas Keyboard** and **Everboard**, with the aim of re-inventing the typing experience on a mobile phone, while also re-defining the boundaries of a software keyboard and how it can integrate with 3rd party services.

I was responsible for developing the entire source code of the apps, while also contributing to the UX/UI design of our products.

Our flagship product, Canvas Keyboard, was featured by Apple on the App Store homepage in 157 countries, recognized as one of the world's top 20 apps created by developers under 20. A second app which I developed prior to starting the company (_Vocalarm_) was also featured in that list.
