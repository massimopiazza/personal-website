<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220101122114/http://canvaskeyboard.com/">Canvas Keyboard</a> was an iOS app designed to eliminate repetitive typing by allowing users to quickly recall frequently used texts and actions through intuitive gestures. Released in <strong>2015</strong>, Canvas introduced an integrated <strong>typing</strong> and <strong>gesture-recognition</strong> experience, streamlining tedious tasks.<br><br>
During my time as co-founder/CTO of WatchApp Inc., I developed the entire source code of the app and part of its UX/UI.<br><br>
Canvas Keyboard was also featured by Apple on the App Store homepage of 157 countries as one of the world's 20 best apps developed by under-20s.<br><br><br>

### How it worked
Users could replace or complement their device’s native keyboard with Canvas, easily assigning personalized gestures to common text snippets and actions. After a simple setup, users could rapidly execute shortcuts by drawing gestures directly on the keyboard.

### Text shortcuts
Canvas significantly simplified repetitive typing tasks. Whether filling out online forms or entering credit card information, users could instantly recall these texts through quick gestures.

### Action shortcuts
Beyond text snippets, Canvas supported action-based shortcuts. Gestures allowed users to swiftly share their location, pull up calendar events, set reminders, or activate text-to-speech functions.

### Unified typing & drawing interface
Canvas seamlessly integrated typing and gesture drawing into a single, intelligent keyboard layout, automatically distinguishing between keystrokes and gestures. This unified interface eliminated the need for constant switching.

### Enhanced typing features
The app also included smart enhancements and shortcuts compared to traditional mobile typing.
- Smart Spacebar: scroll effortlessly through your text. This was later brought into the iOS native keyboard by Apple.
- Smart Shift: quickly capitalize your previously typed word.
- Smart Backspace: instantly delete the last typed sentence.

Canvas Keyboard was a thoughtful blend of convenience and innovation, providing practical gesture-based shortcuts to make everyday digital interactions simpler and faster.
